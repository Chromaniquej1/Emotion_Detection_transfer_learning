# Emotion_Detection_transfer_learning
Computer vision (CV) is the field of study that helps computers to study using different techniques and methods so that it can capture what exists in an image or a video. There are a large number of applications of computer vision that are present today like facial recognition, driverless cars, medical diagnostics, etc. We will discuss one of the interesting applications of CV that is Emotion Detection through facial expressions. CV can recognize and tell you what your emotion is by just looking at your facial expressions. It can detect whether you are angry, happy, sad, etc.

The article demonstrates a computer vision model that we will build using Keras and VGG16 â€“ a variant of Convolutional Neural Network. We will use this model to check the emotions in real-time using OpenCV and webcam. We will be working with Jupyter Notebook to build the model. You can use any other IDE as well.
